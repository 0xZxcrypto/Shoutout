# Shoutout

A minimal vApp on **Soundness** that lets users post short public messages ("shoutouts") visible to the community. Simple, lightweight, and funâ€”designed to test on-chain messaging concepts.

## Features
- Write messages up to **200 characters**.
- Messages appear instantly on the board (simulation before on-chain integration).
- Clean, responsive, and professional UI.

## Demo
Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the shoutout board in action.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Type your message in the input box.
3. Click **Post**, your message will appear below the form.
4. Repeat to post multiple shoutouts.

## Possible Next Steps

- Add reactions, tips, or message filters.
- Store messages permanently on-chain using Soundness.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (vanilla, no backend needed)
